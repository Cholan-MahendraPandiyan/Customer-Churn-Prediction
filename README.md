Customer Churn Prediction

Use a telecom dataset to predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage, service complaints and other features. This will involve handling imbalanced data and feature engineering.
In this project, I used machine learning to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset. After preprocessing and balancing the data, a Random Forest Classifier was tuned for accuracy and F1-score. Achieving 85.05% accuracy and 85.53% F1-score, the model effectively identifies potential churners, helping businesses retain customers proactively

Metric to optimize : Accuracy and F1-score.
